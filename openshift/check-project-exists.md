# Check If an OpenShift Project in Cluster 1 Exists in Cluster 2

Quick and dirty, could definitely be improved. Taken [almost verbatim from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35736129).

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys

if (len(sys.argv) < 2):
    print("""
Usage:
    This script is for checking which OpenShift projects from one
    cluster exist in another.

    It takes 2 arguments which are files containing lists of project
    names. These files can be generated by using the following `oc`
    commands:

        oc login ${1}
        oc get projects -o custom-columns=:.metadata.name > 1-projects
        oc login ${2}
        oc get projects -o custom-columns=:.metadata.name > 2-projects

    These lists can then be used as arguments to this file:

        python check-project-exists.py 1-projects 2-projects
    """)
    exit(1)

with open(sys.argv[1]) as f_a, open(sys.argv[2]) as f_b:
    a_lines = set(f_a.read().splitlines())
    b_lines = set(f_b.read().splitlines())
for line in a_lines:
    if (line in b_lines and line != ""):
        print(line)
```
